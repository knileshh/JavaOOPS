# 📘 Graphs Roadmap for DSA & CP

## ✅ Stage 0: Basics of Graph Representation
- [ ] Learn adjacency list representation
- [ ] Learn adjacency matrix representation
- [ ] Understand directed vs undirected graphs
- [ ] Understand weighted vs unweighted graphs
- [ ] Implement a simple graph printer (neighbors of each node)

---

## ✅ Stage 1: Traversals (BFS / DFS)
- [ ] Implement DFS (recursive + stack)
- [ ] Implement BFS (queue)
- [ ] Connected components using DFS/BFS
- [ ] Check if a graph is bipartite (2-coloring)
